Banking Blockchain 🏦🔗

📌 Overview

This project is a **blockchain prototype in Python** built for the **banking domain**.
It demonstrates how blockchain can securely record and manage banking operations such as **deposits, interest credits, and money transfers**.

 🎯 Objective

* Securely record all banking transactions.
* Eliminate fraud through **immutable ledger entries**.
* Provide **transparency** between customers and banks.
* Reduce delays and costs in transaction processing.

🛠️ Features

* Add transactions like deposits, transfers, and loan repayments.
* Store multiple operations in blocks.
* Use **SHA-256 hashing** to ensure immutability.
* Maintain a chain of blocks as a **tamper-proof banking ledger**.

💻 Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Hashlib** (for SHA-256 hashing)
* **JSON** (for structured transaction data)

📜 Example Transactions

* Customer deposits money into the bank.
* Bank credits interest to customer account.
* Customer transfers money to another customer.

✅ Conclusion

This project shows how **blockchain can transform banking** by making transaction records:

* **Secure** → Cryptographic hashes prevent tampering.
* **Transparent** → Banks and customers can track transactions in real time.
* **Efficient** → Faster settlement without middlemen.

Blockchain has the potential to build **trustworthy and modern banking systems** for the future.
